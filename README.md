# Project Description


## Purpose
Although Java has a Stack class already available, it is good to implement some data
structures ourselves using more basic classes, in order to understand in detail how
the data can be represented and how the data structure's associated methods really
work. The stack is relatively simple, and it affords a good starting case.
This assignment involves working with some starter code that implements an actual
desktop/laptop application program. Thus, we get to put the stack data structure to
use in a realistic setting.

## Description
In this assignment you'll add an Undo feature and a Redo feature to a Java
application for image enhancement. These features should make use of stacks. Parts
of the challenge will be the implementation of the stack operations and integrating it
into the application.
